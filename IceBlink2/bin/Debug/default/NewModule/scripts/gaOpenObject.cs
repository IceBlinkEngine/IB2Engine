//p1: key resref, p2: true/false for removing key, p3 trait for pick lock, p4 dc for pick lock 
//parm1 = (string) key resref, use none for no key required
//parm2 = (bool) true/false for removing key, if true the key is removed from inventory after usage
//parm3 = (string) trait for pick lock, like eg mechanist 
//parm4 = (int) dc for pick lock, like eg 15 (use 10 more than the trait level you aim at)
