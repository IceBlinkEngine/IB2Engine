//gaGiveXP.cs - Gives Experience Points to the party.
//parm1 = (int) amount of XP to the party (will be divided evenly amoung party members if parm2 remains blank).
//             ex. if parm1 = 1000, no entry for parm 2 and the party size is 4, each PC will get 250 XP.
//parm2 = specify a single pc to get the full XP (instead of splitting within whole party). "-1" (without "") is for partyleader/current speaker, 0 to 5 for pc order number in party or just use the name of the pc to address by name (eg Drin).
//parm3 = none
//parm4 = none
