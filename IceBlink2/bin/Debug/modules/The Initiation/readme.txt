Hi! Thanks for testing my game. Right now, there are about four or five hour of gameplay (I think). 

INSTALLING AND RUNNING THE GAME
1. Download the Iceblink Engine here:
 https://www.dropbox.com/s/1esumw5ojbfg147/IB_Beta_v88%20%282%29.zip?dl=0
You will be prompted for Dropbox login info, but you don’t need to log in to download the engine. Unzip the files to whatever location you like.
2. Download Let’s Go Down to Dungeon-Town here:

3. Unzip the file and move the folder “Combat & Conversation” to the “Modules” folder (IB_Beta_v88 (2)/modules)

4. Open the game engine by double-clicking the “IceBlink2” .exe in the main IB_Beta_v88 folder.

5. Search for “Let’s Go Down to Dungeon-Town” among the available IceBlink games.

6. Click on “Dungeon-Town.”

CREATING A CHARACTER AND PARTY
For the game to run properly, you need to create a party of four characters. 

1. After creating a new game, click “Remove Character” to remove the placeholder character (“Remove this From Party”).

2. Click “Create Character.”

3. Choose your character’s appearance by clicking the white squares to the right of “Character Name.” There are matching big and small portraits. Make sure to select both.

4. Choose character name, temperament, gender, and character class.

5. Roll stats for the character as many times as you wish. Note that temperament affects the stats. I don’t have much documentation (yet) for how stats affect the game. Here is a rough idea:

Strength: affects your ability to hit and do damage with a close combat weapon
Dexterity : affects AC, reflex defense, and your ability to hit and do damage with a ranged weapon
Constitution: affects fortitude defense and how many HP you have
Intelligence: affects will defense and how many SP you have
Wisdom: affects your ability to use traits successfully
Charisma: affects interactions with other characters and XP rewards 

6. After you are done with this portion of character creation, you can select traits and powers for the character. I recommend choosing some of the class-based traits (Folk Magic, Thaumaturgy, Divine Folly, Mechanical Acuity, Tactician of Great Perspicacity, Vigilant Leader, Natural Philosophy, and Red in Tooth and Claw). It would be helpful to have at least one character capable of healing, too.

7. When you are done, click “Add Character” to add the character to the party.

8. Do this same process for three more characters (NOTE: The game needs to have a party of four characters exactly.)

PLAYING THE GAME

1. Turn on the music! It’s important. Toggle the music by clicking the musical note in the lower left hand corner of the screen.

2. Keep on eye on your rations. Rations are food you consume over the course of the game. You also consume a ration after every combat. You can carry a maximum of 8 rations, and once you’re below that you start losing HP and SP. More rations can be purchased at the inn.

3. Make sure your characters are using equipment. Equip characters by going into the “Character” screen, selecting the area you want to equip, and choosing a piece of equipment. You’ll want to do this very early. Equipment can be purchased at the inn. 

4. Save! Save often – the game can be challenging. It can also stop working properly.


WHAT I WANT TO KNOW
1. What doesn’t work (the game crashes, the game can’t complete, a quest line seems broken, powers or items aren’t working properly).
2. Is it too hard or too easy? 
3. Are there errors or inconsistencies in the writing?
4. Are you having fun?
5. How long did it take you to get from beginning to end? (Total playtime without saves and reloaded games, total playtime with saves and reloaded games, total playtime across multiple playthroughs).
