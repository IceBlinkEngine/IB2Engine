You recall that there is a secret passage near a pond that takes you to behind a waterfall.  The part of the cave beyond the waterfall is often visited by the locals, but they have not discovered the hidden passage.  Only Derik has passed through.  The passage only works for some and only for those who believe it is real.  Continue on through caves to the Port Town.  Find Derik and he will have further instructions.",
